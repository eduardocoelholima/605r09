### Object Serialization
- SerializableObject.java
- This example serializes an object, writes and reads it from a file. Here is
 a couple of ideas on how to play with this code:
     - dump the object using argument 'write'
     - read the object from file using argument 'read'
     - change the dump and see what happens
     - change the String contents in the dump without changing its size
